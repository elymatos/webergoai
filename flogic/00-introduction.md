#### What Is F-Logic, and Why Should You Care?

Let’s face it: logic programming can feel intimidating. Even the name “Frame Logic” sounds like something that belongs in a dusty academic paper. But don’t worry—you don’t need a PhD to use F-Logic. In fact, you already understand many of its ideas if you know what a family tree looks like, how folders have files, or how spreadsheets store data.

**F-Logic (short for Frame Logic)** is a way to model knowledge using _objects_, _classes_, _properties_, and _rules_. Think of it as a mix between:

- A **database** (because it stores facts and values),
    
- An **object-oriented language** (because it uses classes and inheritance), and
    
- A **logic engine** (because it can reason and infer new facts).
    

In short: F-Logic lets you _say what is true_ about your world, and _let the system figure out the rest_.

#### What Makes ErgoAI Different?

ErgoAI is the most complete and modern implementation of F-Logic today. Developed by Coherent Knowledge Systems, it powers real-world applications in law, healthcare, enterprise rules, and the semantic web.

What makes ErgoAI powerful is not just its logic engine, but its full integration with:

- **Databases** (SQL, RDF, OWL, SPARQL)
    
- **Web APIs** (RESTful services)
    
- **Reasoning tools** (inheritance, defeasible logic, constraints, transactions)
    
- **Modern development environments** (Python, Java, and REST interfaces)
    

And yes, it's not just academic: it's used in industry.

#### Why Do People Find It Hard?

Let’s be honest—most people bounce off F-Logic because:

- The _syntax_ looks weird at first (what do those colons mean again?).
    
- There’s _too much power_ all at once (classes, rules, inheritance, constraints, types, actions…).
    
- The _examples_ jump into advanced logic too quickly.
    
- The documentation (while excellent) isn’t structured for gradual learning.
    

That’s where this manual comes in.

#### What You’ll Learn

This guide teaches you F-Logic **from the ground up**, using ErgoAI as the engine. You’ll:

- Learn how to **declare objects and classes**
    
- Use **slots** to model properties
    
- Write **rules** to describe how things should behave
    
- Understand **inheritance and types**
    
- Apply **constraints** to keep your logic clean
    
- Connect to **databases and APIs**
    
- Build **smart systems** with **reasoning and transactions**
    

All in a step-by-step, example-first, plain-language style.

#### How to Use This Manual

You don’t need any previous experience with logic programming. If you can read simple Python or JavaScript, that’s helpful, but not required.

- Every chapter builds on the last.
    
- You’ll see **code examples**, **diagrams**, and **exercises**.
    
- We explain **syntax with intuition**, not just definitions.
    
- At the end, you’ll preview a new way to write logic: a **natural-language-inspired syntax** that compiles into F-Logic.
