   Captures a simple scenario with some non-trivial features, like explicit
   quantifiers.

   Scenario:
      Penguins are birds. Birds normally eat worms, but penguins don't.
      Birds and worms are animals.
      A worm-eater is someone who ate a worm.
      A non-worm-eater is someone who never ate a worm.
      Some penguins and also other birds are listed.
